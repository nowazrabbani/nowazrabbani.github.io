## Abstract
This paper provides the first **theoretical analysis of patch-level routing** in sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models for convolutional neural networks (CNNs).  
We show that patch-level routing introduces **sample-efficiency benefits** under realistic assumptions by directing computation only to the most relevant experts.

The work bridges the gap between MoE theory and practice by:
- describing routing dynamics analytically,
- proving sample-efficient behavior of MoE under convolutional settings,
- validating the theory through extensive experiments.

This paper was **accepted at ICML 2023** with an **Oral Presentation** (top 8.5% of accepted papers).

## Key Contributions
- First theoretical analysis of **patch-level MoE routing** for CNNs  
- Established sample-efficiency guarantees  
- Demonstrated strong empirical performance in vision tasks  
- Provided insights into routing behavior and generalization
