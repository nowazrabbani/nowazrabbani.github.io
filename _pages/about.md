# About Me

I am a Ph.D. candidate in Electrical Engineering at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI), advised by **Prof. Meng Wang**.  
My research centers on developing **efficient, scalable, and theoretically grounded** methods for large AI models, with a focus on sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE).

## Research Interests
- Efficient large-scale AI models  
- Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)  
- Machine learning theory  
- AI accelerator computing (digital + analog)  
- Mixed-precision & heterogeneous computing  

## Education
**RPI** — Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering (2021–2025 expected)  
**University of Dhaka** — M.S. & B.S. in EEE (Rank 1st)
