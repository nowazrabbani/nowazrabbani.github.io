## Welcome

I am a Ph.D. candidate at RPI advised by **Prof. Meng Wang**.  
My research focuses on the **efficiency, theory, and hardware deployment of large AI models**, especially sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE).

I develop training and inference algorithms with **theoretical guarantees**, and collaborate with IBM on efficient deployment on advanced AI accelerators.
