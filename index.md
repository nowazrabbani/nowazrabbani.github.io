## About Me
I am a Ph.D. candidate in Electrical Engineering at RPI advised by **Prof. Meng Wang**.  
My research focuses on the **efficiency, reliability, and mathematical foundations of large AI models**, with special emphasis on sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE).  

I develop computationally efficient training and inference methods with **theoretical guarantees**, supporting real-world deployment in advanced AI hardware.

I am supported by the **IBM PhD Fellowship** for the 2024–2025 academic year.
