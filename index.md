## Welcome

I am a Ph.D. candidate at the [Department of Electrical, Computer, and Systems Engineering](https://ecse.rpi.edu/about) of [Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute](https://www.rpi.edu/), USA. My advisor is Prof. [Meng Wang](https://sites.ecse.rpi.edu/~wang/). Previously, I obtained my B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in Electrical and Electronic Engineering from the University of Dhaka, Bangladesh.

My broad research interest lies in the theoretical and algorithmic aspects of deep learning. My current research focuses on developing **data-, compute-, and memory-efficient** learning and inference methods for large AI models with **theoretical generalization guarantees**.
